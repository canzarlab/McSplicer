exonRefine and sigCount
=======================

This subfolder contains executable files needed for the data preprocessing step prior to running McSplicer. 

* exonRefine used to refine the set of exons into non-overlapping segments.

* sigcount used to parse short RNA-seq read alignments and generate signature counts.

The executable files we provide here were generated and tested under the Linux system x86_64.
  
Binaries for MacOS are available in the subfolder `../bin_osx` [bin_osx](https://github.com/canzarlab/McSplicer/tree/master/bin_osx)

For running the source code, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/canzarlab/sigcount).
