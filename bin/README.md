exonRefine and sigCount
=======================

This subfolder contains executable files needed as a data preprocessing step before running McSplicer. 

* exonRefine used to refine the set of exons into non-overlapping segments.

* sigcount used to parse short RNA-seq read alignments and generate signature counts.

The executable files we provide here were generated under the Linux system:
  
  Architecture:        x86_64
  
  CPU op-mode(s):      32-bit, 64-bit

For running the source code, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/canzarlab/sigcount).
