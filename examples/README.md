McSplicer Example
=================


Here we run McSplicer on an example of ENOPH1 gene obtained from two Autism patients:

1. A patien with mutation (sample ID: ERR2902115_S36, patient ID: 14668)
2. A patien without the mutation (Sample ID: ERR2902117_S5, patient ID: 11414)


All autism patient samples are available [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-7351/samples/?s_page=1&s_pagesize=25).
